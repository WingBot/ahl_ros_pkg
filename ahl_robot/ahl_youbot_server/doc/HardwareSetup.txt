1. Connect base with power supply

2. Connect base with arm
   Both of power supply and EtherCAT should be connected.
   Basically, port 2(which is closer to arm) is used.

3. Connect base with laptop
   Cross cable is used.
   It should be connected to the Ethernet port.

4. Supply power
   Press and hold button near the small display on robot.
   Now you can see the message "24.0V EXT" on in it.

5. Turn off the power
   Apparently, there is no way to turn of the power ...
