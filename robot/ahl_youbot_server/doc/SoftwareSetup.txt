Note:
If you have a problem with connection,
possibly it's because of the name of ethernet.

Please check the name of the ethernet.
Type "ifconfig" and check it.

If ethernet's name is not "eth0", 
edit youbot_driver/config/youbot-ethercat.cfg
and change "EthernetDevice = eth0" to "EthernetDevice = eth*" depending on the name.

Or ...
If it's not eth0 but eth1 or something like that,
please rename it from eth* to eth0.
