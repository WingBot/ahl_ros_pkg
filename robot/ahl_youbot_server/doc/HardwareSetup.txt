1. Connect base with power supply

2. Connect base with arm
   Both of power supply and EtherCAT should be connected.
   Basically, port 2(which is closer to arm) is used.

3. Connect arm with laptop
   Cross cable is used.
   It should be connected to the Ethernet port.
   It's better to connect laptop to arm than laptop to base.

4. Supply base power
   Press and hold button near the small display on robot.
   Now you can see the message "24.0V EXT" on in it.

5. Supply arm power
   Press the button at the arm base. The light will turn green from red.

6. Turn off the power
   Apparently, there is no official way to turn off the power ...




Connector assignment
24 V IN -> connected to AC Adapter
24 V OUT at base -> connected to arm base
EartheCAT 2 -> connected to arm base(right side port)
EartheCAT at arm base -> connected to PC or laptop you'd like to use
